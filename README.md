## Come Fly with Me
My final project is an interactive Unity Executable, which incorporates multiple simulated phenomena such as
* An multi-octave'd Perlin Noise Landscape
* A flocking algorithm implimented within the planes.
* Spatial Audio made using FL Studio*

The work is a stylized simulation of an open sky. The main plane can be controlled via Kinect v2 via outstretching
an audience member's arms to simulate wings. Once the plane gets close enough to other planes, the sound of various
instruments can be heard. After a period of time, the flocking algorithm align the planes, combining the instruments
into a melancholy symphony of sounds.
